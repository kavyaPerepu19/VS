Atomicity   => If possible, complete the transaction; Otherwise, do nothing
Consistency => The database must be in a consistent(correct) state throughout the transactions
Isolation   => Concurrent transactions must run in isolation
Durability  => Persistent storage of data
---------------------------------------
Constructing a database:
Data Models:
== E-R Model
== Relational Model
--------------------------------
E-R(Entity-Relationship) Model:
== Pictorial representation of a database
== The diagram is called ER Diagram or ERD

Entity: Real-world objects in a business context. An enity can be:
== Person => EMPLOYEE, CUSTOMER
== Place => BRANCH
== Thing => ACCOUNT, LOAN, DEPOSIT
== Activity => TRANSACTION

Attributes: Characteristics of an entity
== EMPLOYEE => Emp_id, Emp_name, salary.....
== BRANCH  => Br_Name, Br_code, location, phone, ....
== ACCOUNT => Acc_Id, Acc_type, balance, .....
== TRANSACTION => Tr_Id, Tr_type, Tr_date, amount, ....

Eg(See Figure):
============================================
Steps for constructing an E-R Diagram:
1) Identity entities
2) Identify attributes for each entity
3) Identify Primary Key
4) Establish relationships between entities,if possible
5) Identity the types of relationships between entities
6) Identify modality. Modality specifies whether relationship between two entities is mandatory(1) or optional(0)
