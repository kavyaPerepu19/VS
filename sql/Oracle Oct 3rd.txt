Processing data from multiple tables:
1) Set operators
2) Sub-Queries
3) Joins

1) Set Operators : These operators are used to extract data from two or more sets of values. They include:
== UNION [ALL]  : Either from Set A or Set B or both. ALL includes duplicates
== INTERSECT : Values common in Set A and in Set B
== MINUS : Values only from Set A,but not in Set B

=> List all customers who have either account or loan or both
SQL > SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT
 UNION
SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN;

SQL > SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT
 UNION ALL
SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN;

=> List all customers who have both account and loan
SQL > SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT
 INTERSECT
SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN;

=> List all customers who have only account but not loan
SQL > SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT
 MINUS
SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN;

=> List all customers who have only loan but not account
SQL > SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN
 MINUS
SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT;
--------------------------------------
2) Sub-Queries : Defining a query inside another is called a Sub-Query or a Nested Query. It is of the form Q1(Q2) where Q1 is the Outer Query and Q2 is the Inner Query.
Eg:
=> List all customers who have accounts
SQL > SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_ID IN(
 SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT);

=> List all customers who do not have accounts
SQL > SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_ID NOT IN(
 SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT);

=> List all customers who have loans
SQL > SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_ID IN(
 SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN);

=> List all customers who do not have loans
SQL > SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_ID NOT IN(
 SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN);

=> List all customers who have either account or loan or both
SQL > SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_ID IN(
 SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT
 UNION
SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN);

=> List all customers who have neither account nor loan
SQL > SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_ID NOT IN(
 SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT
 UNION
SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN);

=> List all customers who have both account and loan
SQL > SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_ID IN(
 SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT
 INTERSECT
SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN);

=> List all customers who have only account but not loan
SQL > SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_ID IN(
 SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT
 MINUS
SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN);

=> List all customers who have only loan but not account
SQL > SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_ID IN(
 SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN
 MINUS
SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT);

=> List all customers who have either account or loan but not both
SQL > SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_ID IN(
 (SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT UNION SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN)
 MINUS
 (SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT INTERSECT SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN));

(OR)

SQL > SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUST_ID IN(
 (SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT MINUS SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN)
 UNION
 (SELECT CUST_ID FROM LOAN MINUS SELECT CUST_ID FROM ACCOUNT));
