Limitations of File Systems:
1) Data Redundancy(Repetition or duplication of data)
2) Redundancy leads to data inconsistency : Any changes made in one file will not reflect others
3) Limited data sharing
4) Limited data security
5) Application program overhead
6) Lack of isolation
7) Lack of atomicity
....
======================================
Solution : DBMS(DataBase Management Systems)
=> A database is an organized collection of interrelated data. The database and the application programs that access the database is DBMS.

Advantages of DBMS:
1) Minimal Data Redundancy
2) Minimal application program overhead
3) Extensive data sharing
4) Effective data(Privileges) and transaction(commit and rollback) security
5) Effective backup and recovery facilities
6) ACID(Atomicity-Consistency-Isolation-Durability) properties
===================================
Transaction 
== Repeated business operations
Eg: Bank => deposits, payments, DDs....
    Supermarket => sales, purchases, invoices, inventory...

Query
== Request submitted to a database

Constraint
== Business rule that every database user must follow
Eg:
== Min. Balance must be Rs. 1000
== Max. withdraw limit is Rs. 40000
===================================
