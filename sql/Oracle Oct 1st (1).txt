ON DELETE CASCADE option : Deleting a primary key value, if we want to delete all its child occurences automatically, we use ON DELETE CASCADE option. 

=> This option is used with foreign key declaration as below:
FOREIGN KEY(column-name) REFERENCES base-table(column-name) ON DELETE CASCADE
Eg:
=> Create tables as below:
SQL > CREATE TABLE DEPT(
 DEPT_ID NUMBER(2) PRIMARY KEY,
 DEPT_NAME CHAR(10),
 LOCATION CHAR(10));

SQL > CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(
 EMP_ID NUMBER(3) PRIMARY KEY,
 EMP_NAME CHAR(10),
 SALARY NUMBER(7,2),
 DEPT_ID NUMBER(2) REFERENCES DEPT(DEPT_ID) ON DELETE CASCADE);

=> Insert records into the above table as below:
SQL > INSERT INTO DEPT VALUES(10,'MARKETING','HYDERABAD');
SQL > INSERT INTO DEPT VALUES(20,'FINANCING','AMARAVATHI');
SQL > INSERT INTO DEPT VALUES(30,'HR','NELLORE');
SQL > INSERT INTO DEPT VALUES(40,'PURCHASING','CHENNAI');

SQL > INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES(101,'SURESH',35000.00,10);
SQL > INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES(102,'RAMESH',75000.00,20);
SQL > INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES(103,'MAHESH',30000.00,10);
SQL > INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES(104,'GANESH',15000.00,30);

SQL > SELECT * FROM DEPT;
SQL > SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE;

=> Delete a record from parent table(DEPT) as below:
SQL > DELETE FROM DEPT WHERE DEPT_ID = 10;

=> To check whether the parent and corresponding child records deleted or not, type:
SQL > SELECT * FROM DEPT;
SQL > SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE;
=========================================
Sequences :
=> To assign values for primary keys of a table, Oracle introduced an object, called sequences
Syntax:
SQL > CREATE SEQUENCE sequence-name
 INCREMENT BY value
 START WITH initial-value
 MINVALUE value | NOMINVALUE
 MAXVALUE value | NOMAXVALUE
 CACHE value | NOCACHE
 CYCLE | NOCYCLE;
Eg:
=> Create a table as below:
SQL > CREATE TABLE TRAIN(
 TRAIN_NO NUMBER(4),
 TR_NAME VARCHAR2(20),
 SRC VARCHAR2(10),
 DEST VARCHAR2(10));

=> Create a sequence as below:

SQL > CREATE SEQUENCE TRAIN_SEQ
 INCREMENT BY 1
 START WITH 1001
 MINVALUE 1001
 MAXVALUE 1999
 CACHE 5
 NOCYCLE;

=> Now, insert records into TRAIN table as below:
SQL > INSERT INTO TRAIN VALUES(TRAIN_SEQ.NEXTVAL,'&TR_NAME','&SRC','&DEST');
SQL > /
...
SQL> SELECT * FROM TRAIN;

=> If we want to see the last generated sequence value, type:
SQL > SELECT TRAIN_SEQ.CURRVAL FROM DUAL;

=> If we want to modify the sequence declaration, type:
SQL > ALTER SEQUENCE sequence-name
 INCREMENT BY value
 START WITH initial-value
 MINVALUE value | NOMINVALUE
 MAXVALUE value | NOMAXVALUE
 CACHE value | NOCACHE
 CYCLE | NOCYCLE;

=> To drop a sequence, type:
SQL > DROP SEQUENCE sequence-name;

=> To see the list of sequences available under current user, type:
SQL > SELECT * FROM USER_SEQUENCES;
